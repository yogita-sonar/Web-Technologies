        <dd>  A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or
             logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern digital electronic computers can
              perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers
               to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a nominally complete computer </dd>
